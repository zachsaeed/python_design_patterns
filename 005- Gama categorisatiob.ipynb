    "# Gamma categorization\n",
    "* Design Patterns are typically split into three categories\n",
    "* This is called Gamma Categorisation after Erich Gamma, one of GoF autohors\n",

    "# 1. Creational Patterns\n",
    " * Deal with the creation (construction) of objects\n",
    " * Explicit construction (Using constructors) vs implicit construction (Using Dependency Injection, Reflection etc)\n",
    " * Wholesale (single statement) initialisation vs piecewise (step-by-step) initialisation\n",
    " \n",
    "# 2. Structural Patterns\n",
    " * Concerned with structure of classes (eg class members, class adhering to some interface)\n",
    " * Many structural patterns are wrappers that mimic the underlying class interface\n",
    " * Stress the importance of good API design that make APIs / objects usable for other people\n",
    " \n",
    "# 3. Behavioral Patterns\n",
    " * They are all different; no central theme. \n",
    " * They are all unique in their approach ie they all solve a particular problem in a particular way with a particular set of concerns \n",
