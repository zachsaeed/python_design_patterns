    "We can't say that a software always changes, we just know that 99% of the time does... \n",
    "S.O.L.I.D. is an acronym for the 5 most popular Object Oriented Principles promoted by [Robert Martin] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_C._Martin)\n",
    "\n",
    "SOLID Principles are a set of common practices in Object Oriented Programming (not exclusively) to make software more decoupled, maintainable, extensible, testable, debuggable and easier to change.\n",
    "\n",
    "These Principles are:\n",
    "## Single responsibility principle / Separation of concerns:\n",
    "A class should have only a single responsibility (i.e. changes to only one part of the software’s specification should be able to affect the specification of the class).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Open/closed principle:\n",
    "“software entities … should be open for extension, but closed for modification.”\n",
    "\n",
    "## Liskov substitution principle\n",
    "“objects in a program should be replaceable with instances of their subtypes without altering the correctness of that program.” See also design by contract.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Interface segregation principle\n",
    "“many client-specific interfaces are better than one general-purpose interface.”\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dependency inversion principle\n",
    "one should “depend upon abstractions, not concretions.”\n",
    "\n",
    "TODO:\n",
    "Checout the the specification patter and the rules design pattern\n",
